# boozepoints

Beer app that lets the user find and enter beers calculated into 'Booze Points' as measured by ABV, price and volume.

This project uses Firebase as the database and authentication with a search beer by name option.

Database uses /users and /beers as primary endpoints. Users are logged in via their email address.
